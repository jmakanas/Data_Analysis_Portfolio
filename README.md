# About

Hello, I'm James Makanas, and I'm excited to share my transition from the world of finance to the realm of data analytics. Coming out of high school, I had originally chosen finance for my undergraduate degree, but as I continued to move forward in my career after graduation, I realized I strayed away from what I had a natural inclination towards, which was pattern based problem solving. With that, I decided to make a bold career switch back to something that I have always had a love for and something that I have always had a knack for, which was data driven decision making. This career switch has allowed me to pursue something that I am truly passionate about while also giving me the opportunity to create things that can be largely impactful to the world around me.

A couple years after completing my finance degree at Arizona State University, I decided to pursue a master's degree in business analytics at the University of Dallas to bridge the gap from finance to data analytics. The world of data analytics has truly changed my perspective on the world in general, impacting the way I make decisions in my day to day to life regarding regular things such as my hobbies, my interests, and the way I deal with everyday problems. My hope is to continue to develop this passion while also developing my career.

I currently have experience with Excel, Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and RStudio.

# Portfolio Projects

### Python

#### Predicting Heart Disease
Goal: To create a binary classification model that utilizes health status indicitors to accurately predict whether or not someone is prone to heart disease.

Description: The project focuses on analyzing a data set from the 2020 CDC Health Status Survey. The dataset includes 18 different health status indicators such as smoking, drinking, BMI, etc. The model created is validated utilizing 10-fold cross validation on a portion of the training data not utilized to develop the model.

Skills: Data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization

Technology: Python, numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib

Results: The model created was able to accurately predict heart disease on the test data with 91.41% accuracy.

### SQL

#### Cleaning Nashville Housing Data
Goal: To clean Nashville Housing Data and format it into a way where each column offers data in a way that is easily usable for future queries

Description: The project focuses on practicing basic data cleaning on a Nashville Housing dataset that is not ready to be used for analytical queries. In the project, I separate columns with grouped information, remove duplicate values, and fill null values with information offered within the original dataset.

Skills: The project practices basic SQL functions such as converting dates, parcing information, creating new columns, and removing old unformatted columns.


### Tableau

#### Texas Housing Market
Goal: To aid potential homebuyers in the state of Texas

Description: The project focuses on creating a variety of visualizations based on numerous datasets such as interest rates, Texas Housing Price Index, the United States Housing Price Index, Texas industry employment, and Texas industry salary to create a data story that would've helped a potential homebuyer make an informed decision in the year of 2021 when it was created.

Skills: Data analysis, data visualization

Technology: Tableau

Results: Because of record low interest rates, less volatility in TX HPI compared to US HPI, and employment growth in nearly all job sectors in Texas, it would have been a good time to purchase a home in August 2021. However, specific people such as those within the mining industry and the utilities industry would have needed to be more cautious before entering the Texas housing market because of the specific decline in those industries.
